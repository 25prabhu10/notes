# Monorepo

A software-development strategy in which the code for a number of projects is stored in the same repository

Key benefits of using a monorepo:

- **More Visibility**
- **Improved code sharing**: Easier to share code between projects within the repository, leading to greater consistency and efficiency
- **Standardization**
- **Simplified dependency management**: Centralized management of dependencies across projects, reducing conflicts and ensuring compatibility
- **Faster builds and testing**: Optimized build and testing processes can be implemented, as changes to shared code can be tested more efficiently
- **Enhanced collaboration**: A single repository fosters better collaboration and knowledge sharing among teams

Challenges:

- Increased complexity
- Potential performance issues
- Security concerns

It's important to carefully evaluate the trade-offs before adopting this strategy
