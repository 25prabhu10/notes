# RESTful Web Services

Ref: RESTful Web Services by Leonard Richardson & Sam Ruby

> "HTTP and HTML have been called 'Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of the Internet protocols, only comprehensible as elaborate practical jokes'..."

Protocols built on top of HTTP, designed for building Web Services are:

- WS-Notification
- WS-Security
- WSDL ()
- SOAP ()

**URL** is subset of **URI**

- URL is _Universal Resource Locator_
- URI is _Universal Resource Identifier_
- Your name is an Identifier, so it's an URI.
- But your address is both an Identifier and locator, so it's both an URI and an URL.
