# Software Engineering Concepts

## Course Information

### Course Description

In this course, students will learn about software engineering fundamentals, focusing on software development processes and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). They will master effective coding practices, library integration, and data manipulation with arrays and collections. The course reinforces robust application building through debugging, testing techniques, and collaborative problem-solving.

### Course Delivery

This course is delivered synchronously, requiring you to engage with course materials, activities, and assessments according to a structured timetable. There are two fixed class times per week, as outlined on your timetable on myCambrian, and you are expected to attend all classes in-person. Remote attendance via Zoom is permitted under approved circumstances. You are expected to collaborate and interact with peers and your professor in real-time during all classes.

- In-Person attendance for this class is preferred, however, if you need to attend online, you can do so using the appropriate zoom link.

- If you have not done so already, please enrol in our Program Moodle and [introduce yourself](https://bit.ly/cambrianbagc)

### Assessments

This section explains the different types of assessments. Each type has its unique role in helping you grasp the course content, as described below. Review the Evaluation Methods portion of your course outline for specifics about the number of assessments and their values.

- **Assignments**: These help you dive into the material. You'll explore topics, learn more, and think about what you've learned. Assignments are not just tasks; they're a chance to deeply analyse and reflect on the material.

- **Applied Activities**: This is where you'll put what you've learned into action. It's all about practising the content. These activities are designed specifically to ensure that you can apply the knowledge in real-world or simulated scenarios.

- **Quizzes**: Quizzes test your knowledge on key points, definitions, and practical results from labs or activities. They serve as a quick check on essential terms, concepts, and application outcomes.

Please complete all assessments before the due date indicated in Moodle, late submissions are subject to a 15% penalty. Submissions cannot be accepted after the "CLASSES END" date indicated on the academic schedule.

### Module Sections

Each module below contains one or more of the following headings: Activities, Resources, Supplemental, Assessments.

- **Class**: Items related to specific class sessions, including presentations and recordings.

- **Activities**: Comprises mandatory activities to be primarily completed outside of class, with some in-class time provided to commence these tasks.

- **Resources**: Encompasses key resources that must be fully reviewed by students throughout the duration of the module for a comprehensive understanding of the content.

- **Supplemental**: Offers additional, non-mandatory resources and activities for further exploration, enhancing understanding of the module content.

- **Assessments**: Consists of required evaluations like assignments, quizzes, and practical exercises that will be graded and contribute to the final course mark. These assessments may include content from any class session or module excluding items explicitly marked as supplemental materials.
