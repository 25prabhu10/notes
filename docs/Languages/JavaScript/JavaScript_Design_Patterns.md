# JavaScript Design Patterns

[Unleash JS](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash): Unleash is the open source feature toggle service.

Design patterns are reusable solutions for common problems that occur during software development.

JavaScript is based on prototypes:

As any other object oriented language, JavaScript supports objects, and when we say objects we immediately think of classes and inheritance. This is where things get weird, originally JavaScript had no support for classes, and still uses an inheritance based on prototypes.
Prototype based programming is a style that builds the reuse of features (the inheritance) by reusing already existing objects that are extended and not implemented. We will see this better on the design patterns examples. This characteristic is really important on a lot of patterns.
