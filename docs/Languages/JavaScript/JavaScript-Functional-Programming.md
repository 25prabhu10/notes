# Functional programming in JavaScript

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where:

- **Pure functions** are composed
- **Shared state** is avoided
- **Data is immutable**
- **No side-effects** are produced

JavaScript supports higher-order functions and functions are **first-class citizens**. A function is considered a first-class citizen when it can be declared as a variable, sent to functions as arguments, and returned from functions. This means that functions can do the same things that variables can do. Functions can be declared with `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords the same way variables are declared.


## Imperative vs Declarative

Functional programming is a part of a larger programming paradigm: **declarative programming**.

Declarative programming is a style of programming where applications are structured in a way that prioritizes describing **what should happen** over defining **how it should happen**.

Structural sharing.

Curring - A function that will return a new function until it receives all it's arguments.
Closures - A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
