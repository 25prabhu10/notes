# Microservices

## Monolith Applications

- All components are part of a single unit
- Everything is developed, deployed and scaled as 1 unit
- App usually must be written with 1 tech stack
- Teams need to be careful to not affect each other's work
- 1 single artifact, so you must redeploy the entire application on each update
